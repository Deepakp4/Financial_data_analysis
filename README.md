# Financial Data Science Project

In a recent financial data science project, I tackled issues surrounding loan approval by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, I took this dataset from Kaggle . The initial challenge involved addressing data cleanliness concerns, such as handling null values and anomalous credit score entries exceeding 900. This crucial data preprocessing step laid the foundation for a more accurate and insightful analysis.

To gain a deeper understanding of the dataset, I leveraged data visualization techniques using seaborn and matplotlib. Visualizations, including pair plots, bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps, provided valuable insights into the relationships between various features, setting the stage for further exploration.

For a more quantitative analysis of factors influencing loan approval or rejection, I implemented a machine learning algorithm, specifically the Random Forest Classifier. This choice was informed by its superior performance compared to other algorithms. Utilizing features such as 'Credit Score,' 'Annual Income,' 'Monthly Debt,' 'Years of Credit History,' 'Number of Open Accounts,' 'Number of Credit Problems,' 'Current Credit Balance,' 'Bankruptcies,' and 'Tax Liens,' the model was trained and evaluated, resulting in an accuracy of approximately 81%.

Moreover, the model's interpretability was harnessed to identify the most impactful factor on loan approval. The analysis revealed that 'Credit Score' held the highest importance, contributing significantly with a 25% weight. This detailed exploration and modeling process not only enhanced the accuracy of loan approval predictions but also provided key insights into the critical factors influencing lending decisions.

## Lesson Learned
this finance project highlighted how careful preparation of the data, like dealing with missing values and unusual data points, is crucial for a strong analysis. Visual tools, like seaborn and matplotlib, were really helpful in finding patterns and guiding further investigation.Choosing the right machine learning method, like the Random Forest Classifier, showed how important it is to pick the best tool for the job
